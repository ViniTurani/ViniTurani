🎓 I'm a Computer Science student in the final semesters of my degree at PUCRS (Brazil), with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning — both in theory and in practice.

🧠 My main interests revolve around:

- **Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence** — I’m passionate about building intelligent systems and understanding how they work under the hood: from model architectures and training dynamics to optimization and deployment. My work ranges from classic ML pipelines to advanced deep learning models (including CNNs, Transformers, and LLMs).
  
- **Backend & Infrastructure for AI** — I enjoy designing scalable APIs, inference pipelines, and RAG architectures that bridge robust software engineering with real-world ML applications.

👨‍💻 I like working on projects that challenge both the **engineering** and **research** aspects of AI — such as writing interpreters, experimenting with fine-tuning models, or cleansing data.

🔭 I'm always exploring new tools and methods to push the boundaries of what AI systems can do — and I love building projects that make those ideas tangible and useful.
