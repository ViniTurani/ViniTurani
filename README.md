## Hey, I’m Vinicius

B.Sc. in Computer Science from PUCRS (Brazil) — currently pursuing a **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence** at PUCRS while working as an **AI Software Engineer** at Teia Labs.

### What I do

- **LLMs & AI Agents** — Building production-grade systems with large language models: RAG pipelines, hybrid search with reranking, tool-use agents, and prompt engineering for enterprise applications.

- **ML & Deep Learning** — From training and fine-tuning models (CNNs, U-Nets, Transformers) to optimization and quantization with TensorRT. Experienced across the full lifecycle: data curation, training, evaluation, and deployment.

- **Backend & Infrastructure for AI** — Designing scalable microservices and inference pipelines with FastAPI, Docker, and AWS. Bridging solid software engineering with real-world ML applications.

### What I’ve worked on

- Conversational AI platform with AI agents, hybrid vector search (Milvus), and RAG evaluation (DeepEval) at **Teia Labs**
- Image style transfer with U-Net architectures and custom datasets at **HP/PUCRS (LIS)**
- Privacy-focused local LLM chatbot with RAG and TensorRT optimization at **HP/PUCRS (LIS)**
- Real-time voice assistant POC using OpenAI’s Realtime API with WebRTC

### Tech stack

`Python` `PyTorch` `FastAPI` `TensorRT` `Docker` `AWS` `MongoDB` `Milvus` `HuggingFace` `DeepEval` `Git`

### Where I'm headed

I want to keep growing at the intersection of research and engineering — and eventually lead teams building innovative AI products. I'm driven by hard problems, and I see leadership as the natural next step to multiply impact.
